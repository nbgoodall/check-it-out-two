  - Add, delete & duplicate frames
  - Sort frames

- [ ] Eraser
- [ ] Fix ellipse to work with odd values
- [ ] A better ID function for any entity â€” project, frame, layer â€“ that's idiot (i.e., Nick) proof
- [ ] Combine layer bounds when selecting multiple

- [ ] Show faded layers outside canvas bounds.
- [ ] Layer previews (and maybe more intelligent names...?)

- [ ] Watermarks
- [ ] Responsive!
- [ ] Custom right-click menu with options
- [ ] Triple click to select individual pixels within a layer...
- [ ] Eyedropper (color selector comes with one already, but can make a better one fo sho).
- [x] Re-organise layout â€” colours on right, layers next to the tools on left. Colours should be a block without the silly sliding shit.
- [x] Join layers :O
- [x] Duplicate before or after current frame... (i.e., set the next frame's position)
- [x] Selection rectangle
- [x] Escape key to exit tool
- [x] Highlight layer on hover (also the layer panel)
- [x] Duplicate & delete layers
- [x] Copy & paste layers (works across frames and projects, too ðŸ¤“)
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts for tools â€” change layer position, etc.
- [x] Repeat frame n times (slo-mo effect)

- [x] Click through layers - hover & active need to be the layer pixels, not the bounds...

### Advanced

- [ ] Color gradients...
- [ ] Text... create a pixel font that you can type in.
- [ ] Basic animation automation. Select layer start & end position, the number of frames and whether it should create new frames or edit existing ones... This would be epic.

- [ ] Audio tracks
- [ ] Custom colour selector...
- [ ] Mouse movement interpolation, like game projectiles â€” fill in the gaps...
