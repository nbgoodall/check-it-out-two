### Reasonable

Are layers the right abstraction? E.g. Figma doesn't have layers, but each entity forms its own layer, like drawing a box or a line. But then you don't have pixels a la Photoshop...

It's a question of grouping — do you group by connected pixels and lines/shapes, or make groups explicit with layers?

What about groups instead? Entities? Easily group them?!

Using a tool, automatically create a layer, and make it super easy to join them.

What does fill do...?

Pointer click:
  On layer: select
  Outside: create selection rectangle

- [ ] Show faded layers outside canvas bounds.
- [ ] Resize & rotate layers! This'd be epic omg.
- [ ] Fill frame/crop to edges on export for full-sized icon/gif, etc.
- [ ] Fix transparent backgrounds on export
- [ ] Opacity (alpha channels however that'll work)
- [x] Escape key to exit tool
- [ ] Fix image import with new hashmaps...
- [ ] Saving indicator & alert if exit while saving
- [ ] Change export resolution (currently 500x500)
- [x] Highlight layer on hover (also the layer panel)
- [ ] Duplicate & delete layers
- [ ] Copy & paste layers
- [ ] Copy & paste selections (drag to select...)
- [ ] Copy & paste across projects!
- [ ] Undo & redo
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts for tools — change layer position, etc.
- [ ] Repeat frame n times (slo-mo effect)
- [ ] Skip frame
- [ ] Better colour management.. Don't add all colours when you slide :( Project colours should only be the one's actually used
- [ ] Fill tool to bounds of entire frame — min/max of all layers
- [ ] Favicon GIF or still frame...
- [ ] Watermarks
- [ ] Responsive!
- [ ] Group layers
- [ ] Merge layers — intersect, union, subtract, exclude
- [ ] Eyedropper
- [ ] Click through layers - hover & active need to be the layer pixels, not the bounds...

### Advanced

- [ ] Gradients...
- [ ] Text... create a pixel font that you can type in.
- [ ] Basic animation automation. Select layer start & end position, the number of frames and whether it should create new frames or edit existing ones... This would be epic.
- [ ] Import GIFs
- [ ] Componenets; re-usable sections/sprites, etc. you can just drop-in.
