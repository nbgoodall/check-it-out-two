### Reasonable

What does fill do...?

Pointer click:
  On layer: select
  Outside: create selection rectangle

- [ ] Undo & redo â€” needs history :S
- [ ] Fix ellipse to work with odd values
- [ ] Combine layer bounds when selecting multiple
- [ ] Resize & rotate layers! This'd be epic omg.
- [ ] Rectangle tool *and* square tool
- [ ] Tool side menus for extra options, like circle and rectangle w/ or w/o fill.
- [ ] Group layers
- [ ] Merge layers â€” intersect, union, subtract, exclude
- [ ] Show faded layers outside canvas bounds.
- [ ] Layer previews (and maybe more intelligent names...?)
- [ ] Fix image import with new hashmaps...
- [ ] Better eraser tool...
- [ ] Better colour management.. Don't add all colours when you slide :( Project colours should only be the one's actually used
- [ ] Fill frame/crop to edges on export for full-sized icon/gif, etc.
- [ ] Fix transparent backgrounds on export
- [ ] Opacity (alpha channels however that'll work)
- [ ] Saving indicator & alert if exit while saving
- [ ] Change export resolution (currently 500x500)
- [ ] Favicon GIF or still frame...
- [ ] Watermarks
- [ ] Responsive!
- [ ] Custom right-click menu with options
- [-] Eyedropper (color selector comes with one already...)
- [x] Duplicate before or after current frame... (i.e., set the next frame's position)
- [x] Selection rectangle
- [x] Escape key to exit tool
- [x] Highlight layer on hover (also the layer panel)
- [x] Duplicate & delete layers
- [x] Copy & paste layers (works across frames and projects, too ðŸ¤“)
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts for tools â€” change layer position, etc.
- [x] Repeat frame n times (slo-mo effect)
- [x] Skip frame (set repeat to 0...)
- [x] Click through layers - hover & active need to be the layer pixels, not the bounds...

### Advanced

- [ ] Gradients...
- [ ] Text... create a pixel font that you can type in.
- [ ] Basic animation automation. Select layer start & end position, the number of frames and whether it should create new frames or edit existing ones... This would be epic.

- [ ] Componenets; re-usable sections/sprites, etc. you can just drop-in.
- [ ] Audio tracks
- [ ] Custom colour selector...
